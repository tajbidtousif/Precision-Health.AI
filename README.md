**Precision Health.AI** is an innovative capstone project in our final year at Leading University, Sylhet. Our mission is to enhance individual health through personalized recommendations, powered by machine learning and artificial intelligence.

## Features

- **Personalized Health Recommendation System**: An enhanced Calories Burn and Exercise Recommendation System that we have created. In essence, this technology predicts the number of calories required for burning and generates customized exercise plans for each user based on machine learning, specifically on linear regression. 
It meticulously takes into account an individual's physical attributes, lifestyle, and environment to identify the optimal form of exercise to burn calories, support overall wellness, and aid in weight management..
- **AI Integrated ChatBot**: Real-time health-related assistance powered by GPT-3.5-Turbo.
- **Dynamic Newsletter Board**: Stay updated with the latest health news.
- **Admin & Super Admin Panels**: Tools for managing platform content and user engagement.
